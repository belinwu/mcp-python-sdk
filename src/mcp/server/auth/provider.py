        Many MCP implementations will redirect to a third-party provider to perform
        a second OAuth exchange with that provider. In this sort of setup, the client
        has an OAuth connection with the MCP server, and the MCP server has an OAuth
        connection with the 3rd-party provider. At the end of this flow, the client
        should be redirected to the redirect_uri from params.redirect_uri.

        flow to perform the second redirect, and generates and stores an authorization
        code as part of completing the OAuth authorization step.

        Implementations SHOULD generate an authorization code with at least 160 bits of
        entropy,
        and MUST generate an authorization code with at least 128 bits of entropy.
